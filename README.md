The aridity index also known as the dryness index is the ratio of potential evapotranspiration to precipitation. The aridity index indicates water deficiency. The aridity index is used to classify locations as humid or dry. The evaporation ratio (evaporation index) on the other hand indicates the availability of water in watersheds. The evaporation index is inversely proportional to water availability. For long periods renewable water resources availability is residual precipitation after evaporation loss is deducted. These two ratios provide very useful information about water availability. Understating the powerful potential of the aridity index and evaporation ratio, this app is developed on the Google Earth Engine using NLDAS-2 and MODIS products to map temporal variability of the Aridity Index and Evaporation ratio over CONUS. The app can be found at https://cartoscience.users.earthengine.app/view/aridity-index.
